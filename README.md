## Synopsis

This program will store words in a list. Then, the user will be able to add definitions to those words on a separate screen.

## Motivation

This is an exercise completed at the end of the second week of Epicodus, a code school, to see if we have successfully learned the basics of Object Oriented Java.

## Installation

In order to install word-puzzle-java, you'll need to have [Java] (https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/java-setup) and [Gradle] (https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/setting-up-a-project-with-gradle) installed on your computer. In order to run the application, you'll need to type ``gradle run`` on your command line. All additional libraries will be installed after running gradle.

## Tests

There are both unit tests per object and integration tests associated with this application. The test files can be found under /src/test/java in the ``AppIntegrationTest.java``, ``DefinitionTest.java``, and ``WordTest.java`` files. To run the test suite, you'll need to type ``gradle test`` in your command line.
